# lambda-java8-dynamodb

This code base is an example API built with the Java 8 runtime for AWS Lambda, in
the context of a common use case:  an API backed by Amazon DynamoDB as its data store.
By using Lambda together with DynamoDB, there is no need to deploy or manage servers
for either the application tier or database tier.  If the front end consists of mobile
devices and a web app statically hosted on Amazon S3, the result is a completely serverless
architecture with no need to deploy or manage servers anywhere in the system, in either
the front end or back end.

The example use case is a company which maintains a catalog of sports events, and has decided
to build an API for that catalog backed by DynamoDB.  For each event, the company needs to
have a record that includes the name of the home team, the event date, the name of the other
(away) team,  the sport involved (e.g. basketball, baseball etc.), city, country, etc.  The
home page of the company’s application must display all local events for a user’s favorite
home team, as well as all other sports events in the user’s home city.  Other queries regarding 
events must be supported, but queries to support the home page are the most important.

To keep this example simple, only a single Event table in DynamoDB is used to model the data,
which essentially is a catalog of available events.  Within this table, events are modeled using
a composite key having the home team name as partition key, and event date as sort key, with
the away team name as an ordinary attribute.  This allows an event to be modeled as a single item
in the table.

The primary prerequisite for running the code for this example is to create a table in DynamoDB.
The following attributes are required, with types indicated and whether the attribute functions
as a partition or sort key for the table or a Global Secondary Index (GSI):

	homeTeam:  String, Partition Key
	eventDate:  Number, Sort Key
	awayTeam:  String, GSI Partition Key
	city:  String, GSI Partition Key
	eventId:  Number
	sport:  String
	country:  String


DEPLOYMENT NOTE:

To deploy this API, consider using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model).  Using SAM can simplify
deploying an API, such as this one, built with a single code base that supports multiple Lambda 
functions.  See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html.
